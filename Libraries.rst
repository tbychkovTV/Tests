Introduction
------------

Pine libraries are publications containing functions that can be reused in indicators and strategies. They are useful when you want to reuse functions without having to copy their code in each script that uses them. A library must be published privately or publicly before it can be reused. All libraries are published open-source. A script using a private library cannot be published publicly.

Using a library
---------------



When you publish a script, you control its **visibility** and **access**:

- **Visibility** is controlled by choosing to publish **publicly** or **privately**. See `How do private ideas and scripts differ from public ones? <https://www.tradingview.com/?solution=43000548335>`__ in the Help Center for more details. Publish publicly when you have written a script you think can be useful to TradingViewers. Public scripts are subject to moderation. To avoid moderation, ensure your publication complies with our `House Rules <https://www.tradingview.com/?solution=43000591638>`__ and `Script Publishing Rules <https://www.tradingview.com/?solution=43000590599>`__. Publish privately when you don't want your script visible to all other users, but want to share it with a few friends.
- **Access** determines if users will see your source code, and how they will be able to use your script. There are three access types: *open*, *protected* (reserved to paid accounts) or *invite-only* (reserved to Premium accounts). See `What are the different types of published scripts? <https://www.tradingview.com/?solution=43000482573>`__ in the Help Center for more details.
